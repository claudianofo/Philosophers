-struct for each philosopher
-what is in each struct? 
-create a thread for each philosopher (perhaps rewatch code vault)
-how to handle forks and mutexes

I'm feeling very distracted right now, and that's ok. That's just where I am at today.
Surivor is on my mind which is a classic, survivor is very interesting. Coding can also be very interesting!
I should try and find a way to shift my focus onto some cool coding. Threads!
My goal is to have philosphers done by next week. That shouldn't be too hard. 
I've got my project set up nicely. Now it's time to start implementing some threads. 
Getting a new job is also on my mind and I think that also makes perfect sense. I want a new job!
My heart is no longer with my job. I am hoping to move into some fields that interest me!
It is consuming a lot of my brain power at the moment, because entering this industry feels like a risk.
It's terrifying that I could fail. But nothing worth caring about is risk free.
And I back myself! I will make a great employee. I am very passionate about learning, and I am very dedicated when I care about what I am doing.
I have a positive energy and I am going to be a great coder, with a unique and versatile skillset.
I will be an asset. Even if neither of the current job opportunities work out, I will still gain experience with the process. 
I will keep improving my skills and I think one day I will end up with a really interesting job.
The risks are scary but they make this worthwhile. The reason I am still pursuing this despite the risk means that I care about it, and it means that I back myself to beat the odds.
The fact that I am concerned means that I care. My goals are important to me. And that is never a bad thing in my book (unless your goals are bad haha).
Maybe these jobs will work out, maybe they won't. Someone will hire me at some point- this I am confident of. 
I think my life is amazing. I have a fantastic partner, some wonderful friends, many people who I love and many people who love me.
I have found so many things that bring me joy, and so many things that I am passionate about.
There is so much to explore and so much that I am excited to learn and experience. 
I've learnt so much about myself lately and I'm excited to sink into the person that I really am. I think she is great.
